        <p class="text-muted">It is an important part of the national economy,[3] where it is the world's largest producer of rice, making up 30% of global rice production.[3] It produces the highest rice yields in Asia, at 6.5 metric tons per hectare (2.6 long ton/acre; 2.9 short ton/acre).[4] Rice is produced throughout the nation and is believed to have been first domesticated in the surrounding regions of the Yangtze River and the Yunnan-Guizhou highlands of Southern China. Rice is believed to have been first cultivated around the Yangtze River Valley and Yellow River 11,000 years ago, found upon clustering in the middle of the Yangtze River in the provinces of Hubei and Hunan in central China[5] according to archaeological records. The planting techniques of rice production in China encapsulates techniques such as water loss prevention such as turning soil into mud, and also seed transplantation.</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

        <h4> Amazon deforestation and number of fires show summer of 2019 not a 'normal' year</h4>
        <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" src="e1.jpeg">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
